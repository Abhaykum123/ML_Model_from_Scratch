# ML_Model_from_Scratch

This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning models built **from scratch** using only Python and core libraries such as `numpy` and `pandas`. It is designed for learning and understanding how ML algorithms work internally without relying on machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn` or `TensorFlow`.

## 📚 Implemented Models

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Regression Tree
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Polynomial Regression

Each implementation includes:
- Training from scratch
- Prediction functionality
- Optional visualization (if applicable)
- Comments for learning and understanding

## 🧠 Purpose

This project is for educational purposes to help students, beginners, and self-learners understand:
- How ML algorithms work internally
- The math behind model training and prediction
- Efficient coding practices in ML without frameworks

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for plotting)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhaykum123/ML_Model_from_Scratch.git
cd ML_Model_from_Scratch
````
2. Install dependencies
No major ML libraries required. Make sure numpy and pandas are installed:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

3.Run any model
Each script can be executed independently:
```
python linear_regression.py
```

## 📈 Sample Output
Each script includes toy examples or synthetic datasets and prints:

- Model coefficients

- Predictions

- (Optional) visualizations
